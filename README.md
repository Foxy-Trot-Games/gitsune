# Undulo

## Game Description

Undulo is a pixel platformer created for the GitHub November Game Jam in November 2025. Play as an adorable fox with a pulse gun! Weave through hazards and push enemies to their deaths as you wander the abandoned alien spaceship you wake up in. 

Explore the ship, finding hidden sublevels--collecting ammo and other upgrades as you go--and gathering runes on each level to reach 100%. Make your way to the reactor to stop it exploding.
